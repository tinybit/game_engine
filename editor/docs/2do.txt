	binds stuff:
--finish refactoring quickbind dialog
--finish refactoring binds dialog
--add binds treeview and validation
--add restriction rules to binds editing

	scripts editor:
--detect duplicate functions
--detect globals
--incorrect binds commit (1st binds script gets replaced by some other scripts)
--correct splitter
--restore lua compiler

find that fucking bug that kills off editor completely (try removing binds and going to scripts editor immediately after that)
